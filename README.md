# MarketPullExample
R scripts for data cleaning and for a sample market research project.

This project pulls data from a large dataset (25,564 rows, 63,944 columns). Each row is a single respondent. Certain responses and self-concept data are pulled and filtered in order to perform a principal component analysis which will help determine how to best market to each segment.

This study focuses on female readers of several motorcycle and car magazines.
